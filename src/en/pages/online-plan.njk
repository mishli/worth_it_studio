            <p>Want to train with me, even when you don't have time to get to the studio?<br>
            That's exactly why I created the online program.</p>
            <p>The program is designed for busy women with limited time.<br>
            It's focused, effective, and requires no special equipment.</p>
            <p>In the online coaching program, you get a full, challenging, and personalized training plan
            that you can do anywhere, anytime that works for you, based on your schedule.</p>
            <p>The plan is tailored to the number of days you can train per week
            and the time you have for each session.</p>

            <p>In every program, each exercise comes with a demonstration video,
            with clear explanations on proper form and important cues.</p>
            <p>This way we maintain technique, precision, and progress,
            even when you're training remotely.</p>
            <p>Throughout the entire process, your progress is tracked,
            and you receive precise, personal feedback.</p>
            <p>Once a week we'll have a check-in call,
            review the past week,
            and plan the next one together.</p>
            <p>So you feel stronger, more confident,
            and fitness finally becomes a lasting habit.</p>
            <p>Remote. But with close support and real results.</p>
